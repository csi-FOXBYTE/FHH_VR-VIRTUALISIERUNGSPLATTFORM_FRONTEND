### 4.1 Data Management

- Upload and organization of base data.
- Definition of viewpoints (e.g., for structured data representation).
- Management of existing datasets.

Button: Go to Data Management

#### 4.1.1 Layers

Layers describe the base data.

It is possible to integrate already available 3D Tiles, terrain, or imagery and link them directly—without requiring conversion.

> The convert button is located next to Add, accessible via the dropdown arrow.

Additionally, data can be converted, for example:

- CityGML → 3D Tiles
- DGM format (terrain) → Cesium Terrain Tiles

It is important that data is always packaged in a ZIP file. The internal folder structure does not matter.

> Another important point is the specification of the EPSG code. Since some CityGML formats do not contain it, it must be explicitly defined.

After clicking “Convert,” the data is first uploaded. Immediately afterward, the conversion process starts. You can track progress at any time in the table. If an error occurs, this is indicated in the progress display with an X.

### 4.2 Configuration

- Manage system settings.
- Configure data, APIs, and applications.
- Enables technical integration and customization of the system.

> IMPORTANT!
